 * The kit of parts drivetrain is known as differential drive, tank drive or skid-steer drive.
 *
 * There are two common ways to control this drivetrain: Arcade and Tank
 *
 * Arcade allows one stick to be pressed forward/backwards to power both sides of the drivetrain to move straight forwards/backwards.
 * A second stick (or the second axis of the same stick) can be pushed left/right to turn the robot in place.
 * When one stick is pushed forward and the other is pushed to the side, the robot will power the drivetrain
 * such that it both moves fowards and turns, turning in an arch.
 *
 * Tank drive allows a single stick to control of a single side of the robot.
 * Push the left stick forward to power the left side of the drive train, causing the robot to spin around to the right.
 * Push the right stick to power the motors on the right side.
 * Push both at equal distances to drive forwards/backwards and use at different speeds to turn in different arcs.
 * Push both sticks in opposite directions to spin in place.
 *
 * arcardeDrive can be replaced with tankDrive like so:
 *
 * m_drivetrain.tankDrive(-m_driverController.getRawAxis(1), -m_driverController.getRawAxis(5))
 *
 * Inputs can be squared which decreases the sensitivity of small drive inputs.
 *
 * It literally just takes (your inputs * your inputs), so a 50% (0.5) input from the controller becomes (0.5 * 0.5) -> 0.25
 *
 * This is an option that can be passed into arcade or tank drive:
 * arcadeDrive(double xSpeed, double zRotation, boolean squareInputs)
 *
